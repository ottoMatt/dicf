import os, sys

"""
allow to set the right path in order to run the scripts inside this folder

so we don t have to use the setup.py install to set the correct path

When in developmenetm when running single files within folders, the best way to ensure to make python know your packages is to go to the top of the workspace and excecute your file like so, :
in this example I want to run the file logging_module_test 
go to ~/projects/dicf/Etude
â‡’  python -m etude.tests.logging_module_test

Yes... Python's weird module system...

if someone wants to put it into production with a proper install, one should comment the code here to avoid the double imports trap.
