% Version  : Especial.
% English  : Three interns are residents of the same hospital. On only one
%            day of the week are all three interns on call. No intern
%            is on call on three consecutiveutive days. No two interns are
%            off on the same day more than once a week. The first intern
%            is off on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. The second intern
%            is off on Thursday and Saturday. The third intern is off
%            on Sunday.  Which day of the week are all three interns
%            on call?

% Comments : Dimitris Raptis pointed out [Rap95] that this was trivially
%            unsatisfiable, by resolving prove_all_on_one_day
%            [--all_on(Day)] with all_on_one_day.
% Bugfixes : v1.2.0 - Theorem clause prove_all_on_one_day grounded.
